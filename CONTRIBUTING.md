# Contribution Guidelines
While contributions to this project are welcome, there are some general guidelines you should follow if you do wish to
contribute. Translating the mod is especially welcome as I do not have the ability to provide translations
myself.

# Opening an Issue
Before [creating an issue](https://github.com/SamTheGamer39/MinecraftRailroadBlocks/issues/new/choose), please ensure 
you are on the latest version of this mod, as the issue may already be resolved or the feature added. Additionally, make
sure to avoid making duplicate issues. You should always check to see if anybody else has created the same issue or
feature request.

## Bug Reports
If you encounter an issue and believe it was caused by this mod, we highly encourage you to file a bug report so that
the issue can be addressed. If you're having trouble, but you are unsure if it is a bug, you can instead post in the
[Q&A]() discussion section.
- Please review the [wiki](https://github.com/SamTheGamer39/MinecraftRailroadBlocks/wiki) before opening an issue
- Avoid duplicate issues when possible. Make sure to search for your problem before posting. If you do find an issue for
  your problem, you can use a reaction to indicate that you also have this problem or provide additional information.
- Make sure to list the mod version, mod loader, and loader version information in any issue, otherwise we may not be
  able to help.
- Make sure to list the steps required to reproduce the issue if you know how to reproduce it.
- When possible, provide screenshots or the console output in order to help us understand the issue.

## Feature Request
Feature requests are welcome, however, not all feature requests can be added to the mod. Please keep in mind that this
mod is primarily developed by a solo developer, and I may lack the skills necessary for more advanced feature. However,
you are still more than welcome to provide your suggestions. You may also post suggestions in the
[ideas](https://github.com/SamTheGamer39/MinecraftRailroadBlocks/discussions/categories/ideas) discussion section
instead of making a feature request. This is better if you only have a rough idea or are uncertain if the idea is
reasonable.
- Before posting, check the
  [FAQ](https://github.com/SamTheGamer39/MinecraftRailroadBlocks/wiki/Other-Information#frequently-asked-questions-faq)
  on the wiki, as the FAQ lists some common requests which we cannot meet.
- Avoid duplicate issues when possible. Make sure to search for your problem before posting. If you do find an issue for
  your problem, you can use a reaction to indicate that you also have this problem or provide additional information.
- Please provide precise detail about what you want added and how it will work in the mod. If you're unsure, the
  [ideas](https://github.com/SamTheGamer39/MinecraftRailroadBlocks/discussions/categories/ideas) discussion may be a
  better place for your request.

# Pull Requests
Your pull request should increase a basic description of the proposed changes and any necessary links. It should also be
well-documented. When you submit a pull request, you are indicating that you agree to and have the right to license your
work under the [MIT License](/LICENSE) for this mod. Uploading any copyrighted materials which you do not have the right
to license is illegal and a violation of these guidelines. Please avoid large unrelated changes in one pull request. Try
to focus on only one feature, bug, or addition in each pull request.

*All contributions will be licensed under the [MIT License](/LICENSE) and must be compatible with it.*

## Coding Style
Code contributions should meet the following standards:
- No personal information is in your code (except for your name or username for attribution).
- Please maintain a consistent style throughout your code.
- Comments are used to explain how your code functions.
- Javadoc is used when appropriate.

## Commit Messages
- The first line of a commit is the subject and should be short.
- Leave the second line blank
- The rest of the commit message is for you to explain what changes were made and why.
- If the commit resolves any issues, list the id in the commit
- Avoid making multiple unrelated changes in one commit

## Translations
Translations must be done by you. Use of Google Translate or other services to provide translations is not allowed, as
they are often incorrect. You should be familiar with the language you are translating the mod for.
